## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Auto-Population Logic:
```javascript
// Auto-populate student ID if user is logged in
const currentUser = AuthUtils.getCurrentUser();
if (currentUser && currentUser.studentId) {
  document.getElementById('student-id').value = currentUser.studentId;
  // Automatically load borrowed books for the logged-in user
  loadCurrentlyBorrowedBooks(currentUser.studentId);
}
```

### Book Cover Integration:
```javascript
// Enhanced book cover handling
const bookCoverStyle = book.cover && book.cover.startsWith('http') ? 
  `background-image: url('${book.cover}'); background-size: cover; background-position: center;` :
  `background: ${gradientColors[colorIndex]};`;
```

### Return URL Handling:
```javascript
// Store current URL before redirecting to login
const currentUrl = window.location.href;
localStorage.setItem('returnUrl', currentUrl);

// After login, redirect back to stored URL
const returnUrl = localStorage.getItem('returnUrl');
if (returnUrl) {
  localStorage.removeItem('returnUrl');
  window.location.href = returnUrl;
}
```
